# RealEstateDeFi
Decentralized Real Estate Financing

LAUNCH APP: 

---

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a dApp that demonstrates an ERC 721 smart contract framework for fractionalized real estate. 
This is accomplished through listing a property as an NFT and hosting a crowd sale for a set number of tokens. 
 
 
 ---
 ## Installation Guide

The app is deployed to a Streamlit interface, so to use the app, no installation is required. Simply launch the link at the top of the README.

To run it from local computer, clone repo. From the Terminal, activate conda envirnoment; change directory to repo folder,
and type `streamlit run streamlit.py`. This will launch a web browser with a local URL such as http://localhost:8501. *Note that you will need to install some libraries/dependencies if you do not already have them. You can do so by typing `pip install requirements.txt` into the terminal.*

## Approach

1. Register the NFT with picture and appraisal value
 
2. Mint tokens in a cap that is equal to appraisal value in USD

3. Crowd sale
 
4. Deployer contract which deploys the NFT, tokens, and crowd sale

5. User interface in Streamlit
